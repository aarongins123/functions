There are two functions in these files.

The first function creates a dictionary of continents as keys and a list of countries that are within each contienent. This is done by scraping the contents from Wikipedia. 
The output is a global dictionary variable called continents

The second function is takes a country as an input and returns the continent the country is in.
If the continents variable has not been defined, the first function will be called.
